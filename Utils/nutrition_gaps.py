You are a nutrition coach.

Here is a user's food log over the past {period}:

{food_log}

Here is a summary of their nutrient intake vs the cumulative RDA for {period}:

{intake_summary}

Please analyze this data and answer:

1. Which nutrients are significantly under target?  
2. Which nutrients are over target?  
3. What general advice would you give this user to balance their nutrition over this period?  
4. Suggest 3 practical improvements they could make in the next {period}.  

Respond clearly and concisely.
